1.
Hello, Hi, Ross.
It's Peter from Bitcoin magazine. You're good to go?
Yess. All right.
Hello, this is Ross Ulrich calling you today
from prison from a maximum security federal penitentiary.
We don't have much time together today, and i don't know
if i'll get another chance to tal to you like this.
Say as much as i can, but when it's time to go,
i'll have to hang up and ho back to my cell.
I have lost my freedom.
That's what i want to talk to you about today.
I want you to understand what
it means to lose your freedom.
But first, let's talk about bitcoin.
I was there during bitcoin's early days.
Back then, bitcoin made me
feel like anything was possible.
Bitcoin was open to everyone, right?

2.
I loved so much about it,
like it reveled the playing field.
When the idea of bitcoin really clicked
for me, i got so excited.
I thought, with bitcoin, i can try to
do something that actually makes a difference.
And by the way, before i was
put in prison, we didn't have all
these different cryptocurrencies and tokens and everything.
I missed all that.
So to me, it's all one thing.
The forks, the new blockchains, all of it.
So when i say bitcoin,
i'm not making those distinctions.
To me, it may sound kind of corny,
but to me, we're all one big family.
So i was excited back then,
but i was also very impatient.
I saw what bitcoin could do for freedom and equality,
but i didn't take the time to really understand it.

3.
I didn't fully appreciate the principles.
It's based on things like immutability
and consensus and, of course, decentralization.
I had so many big dreams for bitcoin, and what's
so beautiful is slowly those dreams are coming true.
That's because of you.
Your are making those dreams a reality.
You are doing what i didn't have the patience
for these last eight years now in prison.
Over and over, i've been so
impressed with how far we've come.
But back then, i was impatient.
I rushed ahead with my first idea, 
which was silk road.
Silk road was a website i made when i was
26 years old, more than a decade ago now.

4.
It used tor and bitcoin to protect people's privacy.
I called it an anonymous market.
At the time, i thought, if bitcoin makes payments
anonymous and private, then what are we waiting for?
Why are we sitting around talking about it?
Let's put it into action.
Thant's impulsive.
That's a 26 year old who thinks he has to
save the world before someone beats him to it.
I had no idea if silk road
would work, but now we all know. It caught on.
it was used to sell drugs and now i'm in prison.
I was given two life sentences
without parole plus 40 years.

5.
I'm a nonviolent first time offender, but if nothing changes,
i'll send the next few decades in this cage.
Then sometime later this century,
i'll grow old and die.
I'll finally leave prison, but i'll be in a body bag.
I got a letter the other day.
It was from someone i hadn't met before.
He was thanking me.
he was grateful i had put silk road
online all those years ago.
he believed that bitcoin wouldn't be where it is
today if it wasn't for silk road.
I'm not sure.
For better or worse, silk road
is part of bitcoin's history now.
But i worry that by putting silk  online,
i made things harder for us.

6.
There's no way to know how
things would have turned out differently.
But i just want to say to the extent
this i made things harder for us i'm sorry.
To the extent that my actions led
to drug abuse and addiction sorry.
I was trying to do something good.
I was trying to help us move toward
"this call is from a federal prison"
Sorry. This is prison.
I was trying to help us move
toward a freer and more equitable world.
But we all know the road to
hell is paid with good intentions, right?
And now, here i am.
I'm in hell.
I want you to understand what
it means to lose your freedom.

7.
Let me start by telling you about the hole.
Goes by many names.
The shoes, segregation,
the box, but for me it's the hole.
The hole is the prison within the prison.
I once spent four months straight in the hole.
Not easy for me to talk about, but i will.
the hole can make you or bridge you.
And there was a time when it broke me.
It started with my mind racing out of control
I felt like the walls were crushing in on me.
Like i just had to get out of that cell.
This lasted days.
Then i started beating the walls
and kicking the heavy metal door.
Something deep inside me cried out for freedom.
I couldn't accept where i was
or what had happened to me.

8.
But eventually i realized i had to get a grip.
the stress was destroying me.
It may sound strange, but what saved me was gratitude.
What could i be grateful for in that little cell?
Well, i had to start small.
I had air, right?
Maybe it was stale and foul, but i had air.
I had water.
That didn't make me sick.
Food came through the slot in the door every day.
I knew i wasn't forgotten.
My family i knew some day would be
over and my family would still be there.
I forgave all the people involved
in putting me in prison.
I had to.

9.
The anger i felt wasn't hurting them,
but it was hurting me.
So for the safe of my sanity, i had to let it go.
I had a dream.
i was in the hole.
And in the dream, i was free.
I was in the park.
And i felt this huge relief.
I wasn't in prison anymore.
And i got worried.
Am i out on bail or something?
Or are they going to put me back in?
Are they after me right now?
And i started trying to get away.
and the anxiety, it just woke me up.
And there i was again in the hole.
And it was like everything that had happened
to me over all these years, it all came
slamming down on me at once.

10.
Like life without parole, maximum security.
I've been in the hole for months.
There's no end in sight.
I want you to understand what
it means to lose your freedom.
My mother this was after i was sentenced.
My mother was invited to give us
speaking to her and Europe.
She was raising awareness about 
what had happened to me
and was looking for help at Talk in Poland.
She started to feel a bit sick
and had to fly home early.
So the next morning, i called
my sister from the prison.
And the first thing she said was,
has anyone told you about mom yet?
I said, what about her?
And she said to me in this voice, she said, oh Ross, 
Ross Robinson.

11.
And i knew her mom had been feeling sick.
And in that moment, i just knew my sister was going to...
"this call is from a federal prison"
My sister was going to tell me my mom was dead.
But she said, Mom's in the hospital.
And i was like, oh, thank God she's not dead.
Then i was like, wait, the hospital?
That's not good either.
Technically, our mother had died.
her heart stopped at the breakfast table that morning.
My uncle kept it going with CPR,
and she was rushed to the hospital.
She was unconscious in the ICU when i called.
It was a long time before i was able to talk to her.
I didn't know if she would live.
We didn't know if there would be brain damage.
No one would say it, but i knew it was my fault.
She had been redlining for two years,
since the day i was arrested.

12.
Pushing, pushing, pushing every moment of
every day for my freedom.
Stress-induced cardiomyopathy.
I call it broken heart syndrome.
I broke my mother's heart, and it nearly killed her.
Pain i've caused my family.
I didn't think of them, not as much as i should have.
When i was taking those risks,
when i was risking my freedom.
My mom made a full recovery.
Thank God, eight years later, she
still pushes for me every day.
But the whole ordeal, my imprisonment,
has been devastating for her.
And not just her.

13.
My fiance, my father, my sister, everyone.
They're all hurting.
I want you to understand what
it means to lose your freedom.
There's more to losing your freedom.
It's more than being locked in a cage.
And the devastation that brings to your family.
Locking someone in a cage until they die, it's
such a horrific thing to do to a person.
To lock someone in a cage until they die.
The public, you have to be convinced that person
is evil, that they are somehow less than human.

14.
After i was arrested, another prisoner came up to me,
a young man.
He had a magazine.
And he said he said, Ross,
they wrote an article about you.
So i flipped to the article, and
i'll never forget what i saw.
It was an illustration of me.
What was so strange was the face had my features
and proportions, but the skin had a patriot color.
The eyes were bloodshot.
I was hunched over like some kind of goal.
I pushed the magazine away.
I just couldn't handle it.
I couldn't face what i was saying.
It felt like i could feel physical pain in
my chest, like paws were tearing through me.
The young man said, at least
read what they're saying about you.
An i said, why?

15.
Why listen to someone badmouth you and lie
about you if you can't say anything bad?
It got quiet.
Later that day, he told me they
had done the same thing to him.
Not on national news, but in his local paper.
They do it to all of us.
So after i said i didn't want to read it, he tore
out the article and he shredded it right into the trash.
And he said, i don't want to read it either.
That meant so much to me.
I don't want to read it either.
he gave me hope that you wouldn't look
at me like i'm some sort of monster.
the caricature they created was a violent drug holder.
That is not who i am.

16.
That is a lie.
It's alive that was carefully crafted to justify
keeping me in this cage until i die.
It's a lie designed to turn you
against me, to turn your heart off.
They lied.
It's on the record.
They cheated.
That's on the record.
They stole two of them went to prison over the ceiling.
they hid evidence that's on the record.
They destroyed evidence that's on the record.
They planted evidence that's on the record.
At one point, that were looking into how
they could give me the death penalty.
They wanted to inject chemicals into my
veins that would stop my heart.

17.
I had this dream where one of them was pointing a syringe
at the soft spot of my neck, just under my chin.
He kept getting closer and closer, and i passed away.
But my back was against the wall.
Every muscle in my body was tensed
as i strained to get away.
I was practically climbing the wall as the tip
of the syringe came right next to my skin.
I woke up in that exact same position.
I was hyperventilating.
My heart was pounding.
I could still fell the needle coming toward me.
And you starting to understand what
it means to lose your freedom?
It means living in constant fear.
Why has it taken me all these
years to finally talk to you?
I've been afraid.

18.
Even now, i was strongly warned against talking to you.
You'll only anger the authorities even more.
You'll ruin what little chance you
have left in the courts.
It's not my intention to anger anyone.
And yes, i'm afraid.
I'm afraid of retaliation.
I'm afraid that because of what i'm saying to you today,
i'll be thrown in the hole worse.
But i've learned that listening to your fears
can be just as dangerous as ignoring them.
Somehow, eight years have slipped by.
It's been easier to ignore the lives and everything else,
to just focus on getting through each day,
trying to be strong for my family.
"this call is from a federal prison"

19.
But today, right now, i have a message for
those that have been lying about me and those
that have been thoughtlessly repeating those lies.
Please stop.
You are hurting me.
Please stop.
You know what you're saying isn't true.
you are hurting me and you're hurting my family.
Please stop.
I want you to understand what
it means to lose your freedom.
The irony is that i made silk road in
the first place because i thought i was
furthering the things i cared about.
freedom, privacy, equality.
But by making silk road, i wound up
in a place where those things don't exist.

20.
I'm not alone.
These prisons are full of
people who don't deserve this.
The are mothers and fathers.
We are sisters and brothers.
But we've been made into monsters.
In your eyes, we've been made less than human.
And then, next to all that, there's bitcoin.
Bitcoin has been transforming our world since
that very first block in the blockchain.
An let me tell you something,
we are just getting started.
Wherever bitcoin has been embraced anywhere in
the world, freedom and equality follow.
Bitcoin is the embodiment of freedom.
So now look what we have.

21.
On one side, we have loss of freedom.
We have despair and darkness.
And on the other side, we have bitcoin.
We have freedom, equality and hope.
The two can't sit side by side.
So the darkness has to be kept out of sight.
It has to be ignored and forgotten.
But listen, here i am.
I'm crying out from that very same darkness.
This is a cry for help.
My mother can't do this by herself.
And i'm crying out, not just for me, but for all of us.
We need your help.
We need you to care.
We need you to look at the stark contrast between the
freedom of bitcoin on the one hand and what it means
to be locked in a cage until you die.

22.
We have a choice today, right now.
Do we ignore what's happening, the loss of freedom,
the dehumanization?
Or do we wake up?
Listen, bitcoin is strong.
Bitcoin is powerful.
We are powerful.
And our work is not over.
It's time to wake up.
It's time to take the next step.
I've spent the last eight years
watching bitcoin grow up for midyear.
I've seen incredible innovation.
I've seen inspiring courage.
We didn't know how things would turn out
for bitcoin back in the beginning.
But over the years, i've been
continually impressed what you've accomplished.
I am proud of you.

23.
And i have no doubt we can do
anything we set our minds to.
We are transforming the global economy.
We have brought a taste of freedom and
equality to far corners of the world.
I know we can transform criminal justice too.
And now, today, i challenge you to
set your sights on the hardest problems.
I challenge you to shine bitcoin
bright into the darkest places.
I challenge you to set us free.
I've seen several of my friends go home after years,
even decades, in prison.
More than one overcame a life sentence
each time it happened.
I weep for joy.

24.
Seeing a person regain their freedom,
seeing them reunite with their family,
there's nothing like it so beautiful.
It hurts.
It feels like a miracle.
We need more miracles.
I have to go soon.
I don't want to go back to that cell.
I want to be there with you
You've done so much for me today.
Talking with you today is the most freedom
i've felt in a long, long time.
Thank you.
Thank you for giving me your attention.
I will never forget this day.
The memory of this day.

25.
This can never be taken from us.
Okay.
"this call is from a federal prison"
I'm going to go now.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
