Government is not a monolithic
thing which is your enemy.
it’s a multitudinous thing which is your enemy.
our dream was to enable the future of human freedom
in the early 1990s, a group of mathematicians, misfits, 
hackers and hobbyists came together around a shared belief
that the internet would either demolish artificial walls or
lay the groundwork for an orwellian state.
We can prevent the Ministry of Truth.
They saw a branch of mathematics called
cryptography as a weapon against central planning
and surveillance in this new virtual world.
And what is a cypherpunk?
Cypherpunks are a cryptography activist.
The more i realized how it was a 
really pivotal technology for society, the National Security
Agency declared the unrestrained public discussion on cryptographic
research threatened our national security.
I saw this as the critical fork in 
the road with a future of human freedom.
Coming up, reason presents a forepart series
on a movement that foresaw both the
promise and the peril that lay ahead.

When the Internet upended the world, it’s
like standing on top of the mountain
and saying that this is out there.
You people who are here can say, okay, what
kind of world do we really want to build?
And build it,
the high-tech hayekians
Imagine, if you will, sitting down to
your morning coffee, turning on your home
computer to read the day’s newspaper.
Well, it’s not as far fetched as it may seem.
The freedom issues were very important to us.
This is an example of what
you can order through your computer.
It combines the power of your computer
with the convenience of your telephone.
We saw that information technology could create
a 1984 style tyrannical topdown control society
or it could develop into something that
is a decentralized enabler of human freedom.
And even back then, our dream was
to enable the future of human freedom.
_______________________________________


3.
In the late 1980s, at the dawn of
the online age, a group of young computer
scientists in Silicon Valley started grappling with what
this new technology would mean for society.
We took a look at the potential of computer systems
and thought that for everything about civilization that enables it
to work, we can enable it to work much better.
The most influential figure in what would become
the cypherpunk movement was the physicist Tim May
who envisioned the future Internet as a place
for what he would dubbed crypto anarchy where
lawbreakers, radicals and political dissidents could shield their
activities from government surveillance and control
people doing things that didn’t require permissions from anyone because
the people were untraceable and couldn’t be stopped.
But there was another group that saw
the potential of computers to remake society
gradually from whitin by decentralizing commerce and
improving the dissemination of knowledge.
They were dubbed the High-tech Kayekians because
their worldview was influenced by the work
of Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek.
_______________________________________


4.
The fundamental insights of Hayekian economics was
how separately formulated plans hand to meshwell.
And we saw electronic media as an
enabler of coordination, of complexity that the
word previously was really not capable of.
The clash of visions between the high tech Heyekians
who wanted to build a borderless frictionless global marketplace
and the crypto anarchists who saw the internet as
a technological means of undermining all governments set the
course for the Cypherpunk movement.
If May was the father of the crypto anarchy,
the central figure for the high-tech kayakians was
the economist and entrepreneur Phil Salin.
Now, if you own a personal computer, we are told, you
can shop at home in what’s called the electronic mall.
It was a few years before the invention of
the World Wide Web, but computer companies were offering
a new type of service in which customers could
connect through their phone lines to post messages to
a bulletin board, check their horoscopes, or go shopping.
You can buy items from department stores ranging from
Nordstrom’s to Neiman Marcus, all via computer screen.
Salon, whose outlook was shaped by his careful
_______________________________________
 
5.
reading of Hayek, understood that these services weren’t
merely a curiosity or a digital version of
the old mail order catalog.
They were the beginning of something that had
the potential to one day raise national boundaries
through trade and undermine government power.
In a prescient 1991 essay, he foresaw how the Internet would
change the world by 1995, 2000, and beyond.
The static role of store and shopper, seller and
buyer, author and reader, systems defined by their one
way information flows will be replaced by new forms
of media enabling two way information flows.
Before getting involved with computers, Salin had run
a private rocket company and had coauthored a 
congressional study critical of NASA’s wasteful spending.
But in this view, there was continuity between his
interests in space travel and computing, because in both
industries, technology’s purpose was to drive down the transaction
costs that impede human activity, making it feasible to
explore new frontiers and interact in ways that would otherwise be prohibitively expensive. 


_______________________________________


6.
Now, thanks to breakthroughs in computing, the ability to buy
or obtain exactly the information you need when you want it,
in the form you want it, is about to
explode at a speed unmatched since the invention of printing.
But Salin was foremost an entrepreneur, and in the
mid 1980s, he set out to launch one of
those platforms for buying and selling information.
He called it the American Information Exchange, or Amex
This business that we’re doing is to
make possible a new kind of thing, which is
being able to buy and sell information online.
Amex was a radical idea in the mid 1980s.
Users could buy or sell advice about the real estate
market, writing software or what companies to invest in.
Now, you can say to somebody like Ebay or
like Priceline or like Amazon when we tried to
explain this to people, they simply couldn’t get in.


_______________________________________


7.
They could not wrap their heads around this.
Some of them, i think, couldn’t
imagine the computational end of it.
Milton Friedman didn’t get it, though it was
similar in ways to the online marketplaces that
would launch a decade later, amex was more
than just an idea before its time.
What set it apart was its grounding and
political philosophy and its lofty goal of elevating
individual decision making over central planning.
It was an instantiation of Austrian economics
now put into code and put online.
Something like this could
have profound human consequences.
And that was the vision.
A fluid, transaction oriented market system with
two way feedback, Salon wrote, would result
in crowding out monolithic, mostly government bureaucracies.
We were laying the philosophical foundations of what is
ecommerce that you can now have creative explosion.
It’s going to change the world.
Yes, that’s right.


_______________________________________


8.
Intermediating among large populations of human beings
through electronic means results in all kinds
of fascinating emergence and social behavior.
Amex’s chief architect was the pioneering software engineer
Chip Morningstar, who had come from a stint
at George Lucas’s production studio, where he oversaw
the creation of Habitat, which was one of
the first online virtual communities.
After joining Amex, Morningstar coauthored an essay
which argued that in building a world
in software, detailed central planning is impossible.
The world is just more complicated.
People are more complicated.
You cannot know what all their goals are.
What you can do is you can put them into
an environment in which certain kinds of things are possible.
What you can’t do is tell people what they want.
Phil Salin and Mark Miller and Chip
Morningstar’s ideas about how a future internet
could decentralize society inspired Tim May to
first articulate a radically different vision.
May, who would go on to become the most
influential figure in the Cypherpunk movement, was introduced to
Sailing by Morningstar in December of 1987.


_______________________________________


9.
Chip said, there’s this guy out in Santa
Cruz that you ought to talk to.
As a scientists at Intel, May had solved an 
issue affecting the reliability of the company’s memory chips.
Called the alpha particle problem.
Rich on stock options, he’d been spending his
days at the beach reading science fiction novels,
thinking about how networked personal computers could turn
some of their futuristic scenarios into reality.
So i met with Phil in Redwood
City and he described how amex would work. 
And I said, People aren’t going to
by selling meaningless stuff like surfboard recommendations.
In Mays view, Amex could be useful as
a tool for undermining state power, but only
by shattering legal and social norms.
I said, it’s going to be corporate information.
It’s going to be bomber plans for the B one
bomber who wants to buy that competitor a company.
Who wants to sell that, someone
who has access to that information.
It’s two different types of libertarians.
He didn’t understand the extent to 
which you could benefit the world
by lowering transaction costs for everybody. 


_______________________________________




10.
Like Salin and the hightech Kayakians,
May saw the personal computer as
enabling technology for sweeping societal changes.
But he had a different vision of a 
virtual marketplace for any and all goods and
services, which he dubbed BlackNet, or a technological
means of undermining all governments.
On Amex, user activity was out in the
open, but black net would be impervious to
government tracking and surveillance, and perhaps t would
be a network with no owners at all.
Many people’s first response would be to say
the black net won’t be allowed to happen.
Perhaps, but technology would
probably make it inevitable.
If you don’t physically meet the person,
if you don’t even know what continent
they’re on, you can’t coerce them.
Tim May is a smart guy.
He was great for honing our ideas and
technologies against, but i think him as sort
of the shock jock for cypherpunks.


_______________________________________


11.
i want to live in the world that surrounds
us rather than try and construct one from scratch.
We saw this as emerging from inside the 
world and carrying the world along with it.
In 1988, Amex was acquired
by the software giant autodesk.
A growing scene of young technologists came
together around Salin and the high-tech Hayekiani,
all working towards a common vision of
enhancing human freedom through networked personal computing
It was this hot house of ideas
from which a worldview was brilliant.
Salin died of cancer in 1991, the same year
that the World Wide Web became publicly available.
But his intellectual contributions and conflict with May had
laid the groundwork for what would come next for
the cypherpunks the long effort to build a selfsovereign
and anonymous form of digital money and the embrace
of a branch of mathematics called cryptography, which they
come to view as the key to personal liberation on the Internet.

The title of the book is
The rise of the computer state.
What i’m saying is the large bureaucracies with
the power that the computer gives them become
more powerful and that they are escaping the
checks and balances of representative democracy.
In 1983, the New York Times reporter David Burnham
warned that the integration of computers into every aspect 
of daily life could lead to a level of
automated surveillance unknown in any previous age.
For society to change course, Burnham argued,
citizens would need to rise up through
the democratic process and demand new legal
protections to safeguard their privacy.
There are ways to deal with it.
We have done it, and all i hope is
that we’re on our toes enough and alert enough
to see them and go after them.


_______________________________________


13.
This is just political jawboning.
A few years later, a physicist named Tim May
argued that putting faith in representative democracy was naive
He believed that only innovation could
save us from the Orwellian state.
The interesting things that had happened
had been technological changes the telephone
copy machine, the VCR, computers.
May became a cofounder of the cypherpunk movement, which
come together around the idea that a recent breakthrough
in the field of cryptography was the key innovation
for combating tyranny, comparable to how the crossbow enabled
individuals to go up against medieval armies.
It’s an epiphany.
It’s like standing on top of the mountain 
and seeing that this is out there.
Coming up: reason takes a look at how
one community came to see cryptography as a 
powerful weapon for defeating Big Brother.
Here’s part two in a four part series on 
how the cypherpunk movement anticipated the promise and the
peril that lay ahead when the Internet upend the world
In the late 1970s, there was an astonishing

breakthrough in the field of cryptography.
I saw this as the critical fork in 
the road for the future of human freedom.
I really did.
In the summer of 77, Mark Miller was
a 20 year old student at Yale working
for a countercultural tech visionary named Ted Nelson.
Like many future cypherpunks, he would learn of
this groundbreaking discovery when the August issue of
Scientific American arrived at his door.
And i'm reading i’m reading Martin Gardner’s
mathematical games column, and i just get
incredibly excited, just incredibly excited.
I call up Ted in the middle of the night, and
I tell Ted, we can prevent the Ministry of Truth.
As Gardner told his readers, a discovery
had been made that would revolutionize the
entire field of secret communication.


_______________________________________


15.
It was the work of teams of mathematicians
and computer scientists at MIT and Stanford, including
a young researcher named Whitfield Diffie.
If you look at 1791 at the moment of
the Bill of Rights, impenetrably
private conversations dominated.
What the framers didn’t foresee is that private
communication would happen via computers, sending messages 
across the world that could easily be intercepted.
Public key cryptography gives you a mechanism whereby
you can recover this ability to have an
impenetrably private conversation between two people.
Look at this
a cipher
Well, let’s go back to the
office and get started on it.
Sending a secret message used to involve
translating words through a secret code that
spies and government agents could potentially crack.
Phil, i think i’ve got it. Good.
Z is D, V is E.


_______________________________________


16.
Anyone sending and receiving messages also had to
have a copy of the secret key or
transation device, just like the decipher rings collected
by american schoolchildren starting in the 1930s.
Here’s how you can get one for your very own.
First, get a jar of chocolate flavored ovaltine
public key cryptography made decoding devices unnecessary, and
figuring out the pattern effectively impossible.
Superman
The big breakthrough was an easy to solve
mathematical formula that you could funnel words into just
as easily as dropping them through a trap door.
But if you flip the problem around and tried
to pull the message out the other side in 
that direction, the formula was almost impossible to solve,
such that even a supercomputer trying random numbers would
need 40 quadrillion years to service the answer.
But the person who set up the mathematical
formula, or trapdoor, held the answer to the 
problem or secret code, making it possible for
that person to retrieve the original message.


_______________________________________


17.
it could also be compared to the
most ubiquitous trapdoor system for sending messages.
Consider a mailbox.
Anyone can throw a letter in a mailbox, but only
the mailman who has a key can take it out.
Anyone in the word could set up one of
these equations, serving as the mailman of his or
her very own impenetrable virtual letter box
And because that individual could prove ownership of the
mailbox by opening it with the only known key,
public key cryptography also made it possible to set
up a provable identity on the Internet completely disconnected
from any real world personal information.
Knowing economics, what we do, and looking at
what’s happening with the Internet, what can you
see happening way out there in the future?
The most striking non obvious thing is that current
technologies are in the process of giving us a
level of privacy we have never had before.
Essentially, there are now well known ways available in free
software of encrypting messages so that only the intended recipient
can read them, so that if the FBI intercepts them it’s gibberish to them.


_______________________________________




18.
One way of reading the second amendment is that it
was a way of making sure that if the
government tried to suppress the people, the people would win,
and militia wouldn’t be very good, but if would
outnumber the professionals 100 to one.
In the modern world, the weapons that the army has differed
by a lot more than they did in the 18th century.
But i also think that if you look
at what politics are like nowadays, the real
wars between the government and the population are
information wars, not physical wars.
Encryption means that it can’t arrest you.
They can’t blackmail your key people, can’t do any
of the things government might do to make sure
the public information is what they wanted.
Meanwhile the US Intelligence community was doing everything
in its power to keep this new tool
out of the hands of the public.
Well, somebody once said to me, if you think new
directions had an impact on the outside world, you should
have seen the impact it had at NSA.


_______________________________________


19.
In part three in this series, we’ll look at the US
Government’s effort to halt the widespread use of
public key cryptography by threatening criminal prosecution and
the legal and public relations battle waged by
one founding member of the cypherpunks for freedom
of speech and software.
PAUSA
A hurricane of unrestrained joy sweeps through
every part of a war sick world.
The breaking of encryption was
essential to the war effort.
England would probably have fallen if they had not been
able to read the enigma messages, because every time the
germans sent bombers, the RAF knew where they were sending
them and could mask the planes there to defend.
If any significant fraction of those attacks had
gotten through, england would have been much more
helpless, may well have fallen, and the course
of world war II may have changed.

And that is the origin of the
regulations that said, this is ammunition.
This is an item of war.
And the problem was, they didn’t really
take freedom of speech, freedom of inquiry,
academic freedom into account in that.
But on the matter of encrypted
… terrorists are going to have greater access … 
… these are law enforcement power that are essentially …
… protect wiretapping and authority
me, when i have to save somebody’s life to go in and get vital
information, i think that’s the same choice we have.
Coming up: the story of the US
Government’s long battle to keep strong encryption
out of the hands of its citizens
and how first amendment activists fought back.

------------------PART C------------------
_______________________________________


21.
Here’s part three in a four part series
on how the cypherpunk movement of the 1990s
anticipated the promise and the peril that lay ahead.
When the internet upended the world
In 1977 researchers at MIT made an astonishing discovery a
mathematical system for encrypting secret messages so
powerful that it had the potential to
make government spying effectively impossible.
But before these mathematicians could publish their research,
the NSA made it clear that doing so
could land them in federal prison.
The US government considered these mathematical
systems modern weapons technologies and distributing
them was a crime.
under the International Traffic and Arm Regulations,
MIT halted plans to distribute the paper.
I decided, quite literally they are going
to classify this over my dead body.
Mark Miller was a 20 years old student at Yale
who had read about this discovery in Scientific American.


_______________________________________


22.
So i traveled to MIT, managed to get my
hand on a paper copy of this thing.
I went to a variety of different coffee shops, so
I wasn’t making lots of copies in any one place.
I sent them to home and hobbyist, computer
organizations and magazines all across the country.
And I gave copies of the paper to some
select friends of mine and i told them if
I disappear, make sure this gets out
Early in 1978, the US federal government backed
off and decided to allow publication.
And the world has been on a 
different course ever since it got published.
But the crypto wars were just getting started.
In the late 70s, the National Security Agency
declared the unrestrained public discussion
of cryptographic research threatened our national security.
The private cryptography community and the government have
been sparring over the issue ever since.


_______________________________________


23.
Marshall McLuhan said that one day we
would all live in a global village.
Well the global village has arrived and 
its main street is called the internet.
The internet also created an electronic surveillance apparatus that
was like nothing the world had ever seen.
Which meant that the cryptography breakthroughs of the
1970s were no longer a rarefied topic.
Thy were privacy, salvation.
Internet users could shield their
online activities from spying.
And that sent the intelligence community
once again scrambling to stop the
dissemination of this powerful tool.
In 1991, a software developer named
Phil Zimmerman released the first relatively
easy-to-use secret messaging system built with
strong encryption, which was called PGP.
Somehow it got overseas.
Now that it’s over there, people are using it and
I’m delighted to hear some good stories about how it’s
used in place where there are oppressive governments.
So the US Justice Department launched a three
year criminal investigation of Zimmerman on the grounds
that by making his software accessible outside the
country, he could be guilty of exporting weapons
under the Arm Control Act.


_______________________________________




24.
Meanwhile, the National Security Agency argued
that Zimmerman’s software would be used
by child molesters and criminals.
PGP, they’d say, is out there
to protect freedom fighters in Latvia.
Said the NSA’s General Counsel.
But the fact is the only use that has come
to the attention of law enforcement agencies is a guy
who was using PGP so the police could not tell
what little boys he had seduced over the net.
Child pornographers, terrorists, money
launderers, take your pick.
These are the people who will be invoked
as the bringers of death and disruption.
Well, it’s true, it’s true, it’s true.
So they’re right.
Yes, but all technologies have had bad effects.
The telephones allow extortion, death
threats, bomb threats, kidnapping cases.
Uncrontrolled publishing of books could
allow satanic books to appear.
The cypherpunks argued that PGP was like any other published
material, because under the hood, it was just a series
of instructions to be carried out by a machine.


_______________________________________




25.
Restraint on freedom of expression of software writers
is anathema of free society and a violation
of the First Amendment, wrote the economist and
enterpreneur Phil Salin in a 1991 essay titled
Freedom of Speech and Software.
Encryption can't be controlled whether or not
it's powerful or has impacts on the
government because it's fee speech.
In the early 90s, John Gilmore, who was a 
cofounder of the Cypherpunk movement, risked going to jail
in his campaign to force the government to acknowledge
the regulating encryption violated the First Amendment.
We basically had a community of
a thousand people scattered around.
We were all trying different ideas on how to get
around the government to get encryption to the masses.
What we're afraid of several years from now is
the terrorists both hit their encryption button on the
telephone, and even though we have access, we can't
understand what they're saying on a realtime basis.


_______________________________________


26.
The Clinton administration told Congress that Americans have
no constitutional right to choose their own method
of encryption and push for legislation that would
require companies to build in a mechanism for
law enforcement agencies to break in.
We're in favor of strong encryption, robust encryption.
We just want to make sure we have a trapdoor
and a key under some judge's authority where we can
get there if somebody is planning a crime.
The cypherpunks look for ways to undercut the government's
case by pointing out the similarities between encryption
software and other forms of protected speech.
Whit Phil Zimmerman under federal investigation for making
his software available for download outside the US.
To prove a point, he convinced MIT press
to mirror his action in the analog world
by printing out the PGP source code, adding
a binding, and shipping it to European bookstores.
The government knew if they went to court to suppress
the publication of a book from a university, that they
would lose, and they would lose in a hurry.
There were people who actually got encryption code
tattooed on their bodies an then started asking,
Can I go to a foreign country?


_______________________________________


27.
We printed up t-shirts that had encryption
code on them and submitted them to
the government office of Munitions Control.
Can we publish this tshirt?
Ultimately, they never answered that query because they realized
to say no would be to invite a lawsuit they would lose.
And so the best answer was no
answer at all.
Talk a little bit more about encryption technology. No. No.
Thank you.
I hesitate even to make use of the word it,
but I'm not using it anymore. Right.
In 1996, the Justice Department announced that it wouldn't
pursue criminal charges against Phil Zimmerman, and major court
victories came when two federal judges found that encryption
is protected by the First Amendment.
The crypto wars are still ongoing.
What we won in the first round was the right to publish
it and the right to put in mass market software.
But what we didn't actually do is
deploy it in mass market software.
Now there are major companies building serious encryption
into their product, and we're getting a lot
of pushback from the government about this.


_______________________________________


28.
We're about the rule of law, but we don't 
want to create spaces that are beyond the reach
of the law in the United States. Right.
It's just the reprehensible behavior of sexual
predation on children, but myriad additional forms of
serious crime enabled by EndtoEnd encryption.
I'm not optimistic that privacy will
prevail in the crypto wars.
It's an ongoing struggle.
In the early 90s, at the same time
that Gilmore was fighting his legal battle for freedom
of speech and software, the cypherpunks were exploring cryptography's
potential in the context of collapsing political borders and
the rise of liberal democracy.
Part four in this series will look
at how those dreams turn on disillusionment
the death of the cypherpunk movement and
it's rebirth following the invention of Bitcoin.


_______________________________________


29.
You're looking at this going, wow, wouldn't 
it be amazing if this worked?
And then you realize, oh my gosh, it does work.
National borders are just speed
bumps on the information super highway
Cryptography is really, really strong.
We can do whatever we want here.
People might provide the equivalent of what
government does in a decentralized fashion.
I talk about collapse of governments.
I think we actually saw that in the Middle
Ages, probably as a result of the printing press.
This is the story of a community of
scientists, mathematicians, philosophers, and activists who believe that
the Internet, combined with recent breakthroughs in the
field of cryptography, would upend society and usher
in a new era of sovereign individualism.

We have it in our power to begin the
world over again right now and its internal clash
over the optimal path to achieving that goal.
Can evil be done with this technology? Yes.
And so what?
So then?
Deal with it.
Here's the final installment in a four part
series on the origins of the cypherpunk movement
and how it helped shape our modern world.
We see a free world that has achieved a
level of prosperity unprecedented in all human history.
Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.
If you had asked me ten years ago,
is it possible that communism could
collapse by the year 1992
that I would have said, absolutely ridiculous.


_______________________________________


31.
Fall of the Berlin Wall was important to me because
I thought it was the end of history and that
national borders would cease being the walls of prisons.
And so a couple years later when i discovered the
Internet, I thought, oh, this is part of this pattern
where borders and distance stop being barriers to people.
Then i discovered a whole clan of people
who self-identified as computer people found my tribe.
And among that clan was the cypherpunks mailing list.
If you want to subscribe to our mailing list, send
a blank email message and just say subscribe cypherpunks.
And what is a cypherpunk? What do you guys think?
Cypherpunks are a cryptography activist.
The cypherpunk email list, which started in the fall
of 1992, one year after the launch of the
World Wide Web, became a gathering place for a
global community interested in using cryptography to allow individuals
to communicate and transact on the Internet privately and
without interference from a central authority.


_______________________________________


32.
In the last 20 years, the basic techniques
to do all sort of impossible seeming things
have suddenly emerged, put them into practice.
Many cypherpunks were inspired by the work of the
computer scientist David Chaum, who had demonstrated that it
was possible to use cryptography to build an anonymous
payment network that ran on the Internet.
Because of the cypherpunks and because of
the science papers of David Chaum.
I thought the third thing that's going to happen
is economic freedom, that people are going to be
no longer constrained by national borders and distance from
cooperating, sharing resources and helping each other.
But at this watershed moment of collapsing borders,
there was a divide within the cypherpunk community
over whether these cryptographic tools would lead to
more individual freedom, free trade and the spread
of democracy or the end of government all together.
The cypherpunk movement's most influential figure was
the physicist and intellectual provocateur Tim May,
who coined the phrase crypto anarchy.


_______________________________________


33.
He saw the fall of the Berlin Wall as evidence that
the societal institutions we take for granted could collapse in short
order, just as they had in the Middle Ages.
We saw the little principalities, the
monarchies, the religious, the Papal States.
We saw those collapse probably as a result
of publishing, printing
May penned a one page summary
of how cryptography would upend society.
So i just sat down at my little
Machintosh and loosely patterned this after the Communist
Manifesto the specter is haunting the modern world,
the specter of crypto anarchy.
Cryptography is really, really strong.
We can be protected from anything without, from the
observes, from the watchers, from the imposers of the
past upon the future we're trying to create.
May was skeptical of the idea that humanity
was witnessing an unabashed victory of economic and
political liberalism or that it was possible to
overcome tyranny through collective action.

Ad the political scientist Francis Fukuyama argued,
we as human being want to be
recognized with a certain dignity.
This is the essential driving force behind democratic
revolutions, whether they take place in Eastern Europe
or in Asia or in Latin America
May embraced a technology based theory of historic change summed
up by the movement's tagline, which was coined
by the mathematician Eric Hughes.
Cypherpunks write code.
What Eric meant by cypherpunks write code is, don't
be one of those guys who goes to a 
Libertarian Party conference and sits about getting somebody elected
to the Los Gato City Council.
That way lies madness.
Whereas the interesting things that had
happened had been technological changes the
telephone, copy machines, the VCR.
The philosophy that i really got interested in
is that you don't just go and ask
the regulator, oh, we need more privacy online.
You could fix it.
Arguing and complaining and lobbying and politics have
nominal effect on what changes the world.
Is technology adoption and
society moving, shifting speed points.

For crypto anarchists like me, writing code
meant building systems for anonymous transactions on
the internet that made the arbitrary divisions
of the political world irrelevant.
National borders are just speed
bumps on the information superhighway.
Online cryptographic networks would be structured like a geodesic
dome, a form hailed by the countercultural technologists of 
the 1970s for being in harmony with nature and
highly resistant to external attack
Networks with no owners, with many interconnecting
nodes that would be basically unstoppable.
In a geodesic market economics will no longer be the
handmaiden of politics, the cypherpunk writer Robert Hettinga
noted, and nation states will eventually be as
ceremonial as modern day constitutional monarchs.
The idea of a many to many
connection was clearly going to happen.
But it was much easier to build a functional
network for cooperation and trade when you can rely
on a central authority to enforce the rules.
How can we use this weird crypto technique
to solve this strange, esoteric little problem that
in the real world, you just solve
because, I know what your Social Security number is, or
you have to have your government issued ID that you
take into the bank so that you can open up
your bank account and they can link the two together
and say, okay, if Jim McCoy walks out on this
100.000$ loan, we know where to find him.

I was trying to deal with those problems.
You can buy and sell property in cyberspace
using cryptographic protocols, the idea of ways in
which people might provide the equivalent of what
government does in a decentralized fashion.
Tim stole some ideas from my machinery of
freedom, and he reprocessed them with all this
technological, and then i stole them back.
A function of government that was particularly hard to
replicate using cryptography was the issuance of money.
The cypherpunks attempted to build a borderless
Internet currency system as anonymous as cash,
and that like gold held its value
without the backing of a central bank.
Gold makes very good money because nobody
can manufacture more of it very readily,
put mildly,
right, whereas bits are perfectly copyable, so
turning bits into good money is quite difficult.
Tim May and many others considered electronic cash to
be the Holy Grail because it completed the picture.

A private and decentralized monetary system, May
argued, was a key component in constructing
a new borderless world where the activities
and assets of individuals would be resistant
to government control and confiscation.
You don't physically meet the person if you
don't even know what content they're on.
You can't coerce them.
But there was another faction within the
movement that rejected Tim May's vision.
According to a new world in cyberspace,
the High-tech Hayekians were people like Eric
Drexler, Mark Miller, Phil Salin.
They were focused on designing secure computing systems
based on economic insights, particularly those of the
Austrian born Nobel Prize winner Friedrich Hayek.
Instead of building a new virtual world
shielded from government interface, the hi-tech Hayekians
sought to use technology to demolish walls
and divisions within the existing world.
They imagined that introducing new tools for
human coordination would gradually erode the government's 
ability to impinge on our freedoms.

We did lots and lots of fantasizing about
how the world could be different, but we
saw this as emerging from inside the world.
Cryptography was tool for porting economic
concepts and legal structures onto the Internet,
but the aim was to foster new
forms of P2P commerce and knowledge sharing.
And the hi tech Hayekians believed that even imperfect
systems can transform society gradually from within.
The overall arc of world history is towards
rule of law, towards less corruptible systems.
If the emergence of the world of crypto commerce
creates systems that are vastly less corruptible but
under a whole mix of different mechanisms and
governance regimes such that they're not always everywhere
incorruptible, I think that's fine.

There's a lot of power in providing people tools such
that they can successfully start to act more like you
would like them to, as opposed to you've got to
come over here where it's really hard edge encrypted and
it works exactly the way we want.
No, no, let's raise people's levels incrementally
and that's an improvement in the world.
For many cypherpunks, the darker side of crypto
anarchy was epitomized by the writings of a
chemist and electrical engineer, Jim Bell, a participant
on email list who, in the mid
90s, compared aggression by the state to that 
of muggers, rapists, robbers and murderers and
posited a cryptographically protected marketplace in which
anonymous individuals could, in effect, pay to
have government employees killed with the goal
of destroying the state.
In 1997, Bell was arrested and went
to prison for, among other things, dropping
a stink bomb on a government building.
Tim May distanced himself from Bell's writings
and activities while maintaining that marketplaces for
assassination like the one Bell had described
might be both inevitable and desirable.

Can evil be done with this technology?
Not just the Internet, but especially
the crypto part of it? Yes.
And so what?
So then
Deal with it.
Zimmerman once told me that he sometimes regretted ever introducing
PGP to the world because it could be used by
Al Qaeda or the Taliban or what not.
I say, so what?
I'm not morally responsible would have happened whether we had
existed or not
because technology has its own logic and
people want to do what they want to do.
I mean, they want free shit,
they want freedom to do things.
Even if they say this should be regulated,
they'll often make the conscious decision to copy
music, copy videotapes they want to see
black net is a negative consequence.

I'm not interested in creating that.
When you build technology to solve problems, then you create
then there are consequences that we try to think ahead of
and look at and figure out how we might address and
get ahead of the downsides of what we build.
And that's responsible development and
we certainly engaged in that.
And talking with Tim May and putting on that
you know
what if I was a black hat kind of thing was
certainly a useful foil for working through those kinds of
ideas, but that's absolutely not what cypherpunks were.
The progress of the spread of democracy, if
you take a sufficiently long term view of
it, has been really quite remarkable.

Our dream was to enable the future of human freedom
and we had this bizarre confidence about how the future
would unfold and to using Alan Cave's famous phrase, to
have a huge hand in inventing it.
But the road had a lot more weeds
and detours that we could have anticipated.
When we first launched, we were
hoping for maybe 400 500 people.
Now we're at 100 thousand people, so
who knows where we're going at.
Using the ever-growing storage capacity of
servers belonging to companies like Google
Instead of being on your server, under your desk.
That stuff is being taken care of for you.
Professionals keep track of all the
programs and the data
… a simpler life.
I find this way of working more simple
You collect half a gigabyte
of information on your customers.
What do you do with that?
They want to know everything about you so
they can sell you stuff and it results
in you each getting a digital proctology exam.
The NSA specifically targets
the communications of everyone.

Over the next quarter century, the internet would make
possible an explosion of individual freedom and information sharing,
just as Phil Salin had predicted in 1991.
But it would also grow into a surveillance apparatus that
bore out the dystopian vision of journalist David BurnHam in
his 1983 book the rise of the computer state.
Large bureaucracies with the power that the computer
gives them become more powerful and they are
escaping the checks and balances of representative democracy.
Facebook collects information that the East
German stasi would have killed for.
I think that most people are quite happy
to hand people all of the information about
them online in return for a few pics
of your high school friends, kids or whatever.
By the mid 2000s, it seemed
the cypherpunk movement had mostly failed.
Then came a global financial crisis, followed
by massive bailouts by central banks.

On october 31, 2008 a pseudonymus inventor
named Satoshi Nakamoto shared a white paper
describing a new P2P non governmental monetary system,
pulling together technical and philosophical concepts developer
on the cypherpunks list.
Within a few years, the movement was reborn
whit a new generation committed to enhancing personal
freedom and privacy with cryptographic tools.
It's like discovering an oasis when
you're lost in the desert.
It's bitcoin that's singlehandedly responsible for
the current wave of cypherpunk activity.
It's always messier that visionaries can anticipate
because reality is bigger than anyone had.
We're still on the road in the quest to
build architectures that amplify human freedoms and protect
us from the dynamics in the other direction.
